In today's fast-paced world, time is of the essence, particularly for busy university students, faculty members, and staff. With the hustle and bustle of academic life, finding time to grab a meal can often be a challenge within 1hr. Recognizing this need for convenience and efficiency, I propose the development of a pre-order system for food within the university campus.
At the heart of my project is the concept of convenience and no time wastage. Users can browse through a selection of food stalls such as Kitchen Atte, Oven Express , Chat Bhandar and many more located within the university campus.

Problems :
1. Time Constraints : Busy university students and faculty often struggle to find time to wait in long lines for food during peak hours, leading to wasted time and potential inconvenience.
2. Inefficiency : time waiting to place orders, receive their food, and pay for their meals
3. Limited Variety : face limited options for meal times
4. Inconvenience : inconvenient to physically visit food stalls in busy periods or inclement weather.
5. Poor Dining Experience : dissatisfaction.

Solution :
1. Time Constraints: Implement a pre-order system that allows users to place their food orders in advance, reducing the need to wait in long lines.
2. Improved Efficiency: Streamline the ordering process through an intuitive online platform where users can easily browse menus, select items, and make payments.
3. Flexible Pickup Times: Users have the option to select their preferred pickup time for their food orders.
4. Flexible Locations: Users have the option to select their preferred food stall location for their food orders.
5. Diverse Menu Options from Multiple Food Stalls: Users can enjoy diverse food options from various campus food stalls according to the userâ€™s choice.
6. User-Friendly Online Platform for convenience: Provide a user-friendly online platform accessible via web or mobile devices, allowing users to conveniently place orders from anywhere on campus
